  <p> There was a google docs with a 32 by 32 grid and we had to draw something that represented who you were so I used the pixels in the canvas to draw the thing that represented me.I added the favicon by taking a screenshot and saving it then going to replit and uploading it after that in the code I added a link so that my favicon would show up when you open a page.  </p>
